            What is it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            BookSearcher helps a user find popular books and check their reviews. The user selects a list from the New York Times Best Seller’s List, then receives all the current best sellers on that list. The user can then browse the list or click on a specific book to get the critics’ reviews and review score for that book. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I built BookSearcher as a practice project to learn new and interesting skills. These were some things that I learned or practiced:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pull and save data from APIs</li>
            <li>Merge data from multiple APIs</li>
            <li>Structure data with many association types and join tables</li>
            <li>Create rake tasks and schedule cron jobs to update the database</li>
            <li>Build a responsive site with media queries</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Why books?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I love to read, especially contemporary books. Staying current is important to me, so I thought it would be fun to make an app that searches the newest, most popular books. I don’t think BookSearcher will change the world. It’s just for fun and practice.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Was it hard?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I built this app while working from coworking spaces in Morocco and Thailand. I was able to work at my own pace, avoiding a lot of the stress that comes with deadlines. In that sense, it wasn’t too mentally draining. In general, this app went much more smoothly than the last one, which I take as a good sign of improvement. Old concepts are solidifying and I’m quicker to understand new concepts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That said, it wouldn’t be programming if I did have some technical challenges along the way. I had done some work with APIs in my bootcamp, but not nearly as extensive as this. The most difficult part was structuring my database in a way that would allow me to easily save the data pulled from the API. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The front-end of BookSearcher was also a challenge for me. At first, I made a page that only looked good on a desktop screen. I had not considered BookSearcher’s responsiveness. On the book list page, I set the background image to a photo of an open book, then split the screen into two columns so that each column would appear to be a page in the book. While this looked awesome on my screen, I quickly realized that it did not look so awesome on a tablet or smartphone. It turns out I picked a really bad background image for a responsive site. But, rather than redesign the entire front-end, I began a deep dive into responsive design and I made it work. By using media queries, I changed the background image for tablets and smartphones and just generally redesigned all the pages for small screens. That was a much bigger undertaking than I expected, but I’m so glad I took it seriously. I learned a ton!
        </p>
        <h3>
            What's next for BookSeacher?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Like I said, BookSearcher was just for fun and practice, so I probably won’t do too much more work on it. But I do have some ideas on how it could be improved.  
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pull more data from the APIs on the authors to display their bios and popular books</li>
            <li>Add a third  API to pull reader reviews and scores (not just critics’ reviews)</li>
            <li>Keep fiddling with the responsiveness because there’s always room for improvement</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What do you think?</h3>
        <p>
            Thanks for checking out BookSearcher! Please let me know if you have any questions, ideas or if you just want to chat!
